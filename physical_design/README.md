# Physical Design (PD) — VLSI / OpenLANE Workshop

## Overview

This repository documents the complete **Physical Design (PD)** workshop across five modules. The workshop progresses from the fundamentals of open-source EDA and the Sky130 PDK through floorplanning, standard-cell placement, cell design and characterization, timing analysis, clock-tree synthesis, power distribution, routing and final physical-design checks.

The five modules collectively provide a practical view of the **RTL-to-GDSII** implementation journey using an open-source tool flow. The detailed module topics are based on the supplied workshop topic list. fileciteturn0file0L1-L16

## Overall RTL-to-GDSII Learning Path

The workshop follows a logical progression:

1. **Understand the technology and flow** — Open-source EDA, Sky130 PDK and OpenLANE.
2. **Prepare the physical organization** — floorplan, utilization, aspect ratio, power and pins.
3. **Bind and place cells** — libraries, placement optimization and congestion awareness.
4. **Build and characterize cells** — CMOS inverter simulation, Magic layout, extraction and DRC.
5. **Analyze timing** — timing libraries, delay tables, OpenSTA and timing constraints.
6. **Build the clock network** — TritonCTS, buffering, H-tree concepts and signal integrity.
7. **Distribute power and route signals** — PDN, global routing and detailed routing.
8. **Perform physical checks and inspect results** — DRC, connectivity, routing topology and post-route outputs.
